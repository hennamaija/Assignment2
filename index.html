            Don’t overuse water. Make sure to close a tap when washing dishes, take short showers – Bathtubs require gallons more water than a 5-10 minute shower. 
            Consider getting a water meter to be aware of your water usage.

            Safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires we invest in adequate infrastructure, provide sanitation facilities, and encourage hygiene. 
            Protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems is essential.
