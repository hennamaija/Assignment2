### Description of the project
The project is a scrollytelling of the sustainable goal 6 Clean Water and sanitation. 

### Why the project is useful
The project is useful, because it will reach out and inform people about the goal. In additon, the project also describes what we can do to improve the situation. 

### Get started with the project
Users can get started with the project by either using the fork option or by cloning this repo. When the user forks the project it is possible to improve the project without ruining our origional project. Then the users can have their own brainstorming, implement new things and share their work with others. 

### Get help with the project
Users can consult learning materials (lectures) or open an issue on this github page.

### Technology
The language used in this project is html, scss, and js. To edit the project we are using Visual Studio Code. 

### Contributes
Henna, Thomas and Ingrid maintains and contributes to the project. 

## Design for Animation 
### Design idea
Different background pictures that changes from every scene with information about the goal. In addition, a water drop timeline on the side that indicates how long the story is.

### Animations
#### Animation on scene 1: 
When the user starts to scroll vertically a water drop from the glass will loosen and move from the glas and go down to the bottom of the scene as the same speed as the user scroll. When the water drop starts to move, the logo shrinks and goes to the right top corner of the page. The logo will stick to the corner and stay there through the whole scrollytelling. 

#### Animations on scene 2:
First will 40% appear, then the text over 40%. This will stand still when the user scrolls. However, the other text scrolls with the user.

#### Animation on scene 6: 
The text appears in three parts 
    the world has lost
    70%
    of its natural wetlands over the last century

and it is some animation on 70%
#### Animation on scene 7: 
Many water drops are moving from the top to the bottom. The water drops are moving behind the text. 

#### Animation on scene 8: 
The lid to the garbage can moves up and down. 

#### Animation on scene 9: 
The water glass is filled with water, the animation makes the water go from full to empty. The water glass should be white. 

#### Animation on scene 10: 
The 2030 is blinking. 

#### Animation on every scene:
When the user scroll down to the next scene, the background picture will have a fade effect and slowly zoom 10%. The text will come from the buttom and goes to the top in the same speed as the user scroll. The statistics stands still when the user scrolls, but with individual animations. The current water drop will move from side to side. As well, the current water drop will fade away when the user has scrolled past the scene. Then a new water drop will appear more white than the other water drops. It is also possible to navigate to the top if the user clicks on the logo. When the user hover over the logo, the opacity will be 50%. 

#### Media queries:
We will use media queries to stop the animations if the user has turned off the animations on the settings of their desktop. We will also use media queries to affect how the user sees the background picture depending on the device being landscape vs portrait. On the scenes with black background, the media queries will change the background color to white and the text color to black if the user prefers light mode.
